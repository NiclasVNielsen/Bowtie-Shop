ToDo
    - High Priority
 * add disabled to products instead of hard deleting them
 * forgot password system
 * limited amount of user feedback when filling out something wrong
 * limited input requirements (email fields don't need @ and .  etc..)
 
    - Low Priority
 * product colors CRUD and use the colors on frontpage
 * search/filter products by color in frontend
 * intergrade total and new order counter on the backend (decrease new counter on handled order)
 * fix casing on files. Someone like stating with uppercase even though we use camelcase
